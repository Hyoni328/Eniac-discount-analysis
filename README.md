# Eniac Discount analysis

## Benefit Analysis of Product Discounts
This project was run in July 2024 as part of the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The goal is to analyse Eniac company data (Orders, Sales, Products, etc.) in order to determine if offering product discounts is advantageous. 

This project's primary arguments were:

- The Marketing Team lead
  : offering discounts will help the business expand and will be beneficial in the long run in terms of customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction.
- The main investor in the Board
  : concerning about offering aggressive discounts, and cited the companyâ€™s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue.
    Instead of trying to give the lowest prices in the market, they would prefer that the company position itself in the quality area.

The presentation aims to last 5 minutes and will be shown to the CEO of Eniac.

## Languages and Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn)

Google Slides

## Key Learnings
Discovering that the largest and most time-consuming task of the project is data cleaning.
Python pandas is more flexible than SQL, and it can be useful not just for data cleaning but also for data visualization by using Seaborn.

## Challenges Overcame
The provided data has limitation in information. there were no customer or discount details throughout the brief 14-month timeframe.
I had to spend a lot of effort cleaning up the quite disorganized data and classifying the product's category in order to help with data understanding and revenue growth.

## Additional Reflections
As always, I am incredibly appreciative of my instructor and teammates' support and assistance with this project.
